# PerryDeque
For this assignment, you will be writing a Deque ADT (i.e., LastnameDeque). A deque 
is closely related to a queue - the name deque stands for "double-ended queue." 
The difference between the two is that with a deque, you can insert, remove, or view, 
from either end of the structure.
